- This describes the essence of democracy; citizens make their own, pressure-free decisions about their government. 

- Same way, students can make these decisions to elect a candidate for the presidential post for the college student council.


- Firstly, let me thank you all for your presence here today. i am mohammed ismail dataanalysis party

- As you all know that I am running for the Presidential post in the upcoming college council election, 

- I would like to use this opportunity to share my views about the kind of work I would love to do for the welfare of the college and the students.


- As a student, I feel that education is not just the pillar of success for us. 

- We all need good services, be it infrastructure, 
		adequate counseling, 
		focus on extracurricular activities, 
                and vocational courses on personality development. 


- It is rightly said, “with great power comes great responsibility”.

- If I get elected, my first work would be to improve the sanitation and hygiene of the students. 

- I shall ensure that our playground and the parking lot are appropriately maintained and sanitized. 

- I am also considering seeking confirmation from the administration to allow two game periods a day, considering the workload we have.


- We are thinking of implementing a photography course and piano classes as vocational subjects in the coming days, 

- and our team is working hard to achieve all these goals. 

- If given this opportunity, I shall fight for equality, justice, and transparency for our student council, where every student gets a chance to raise their voice.

- With my experience and passion, I think I could be a great leader. 

- Friends, I also believe in working as a team, and fighting for justice, whenever the need arises. 

- Together with me, let us work for the well-being of the student and the college. 
- Choose your vote wisely, and may the best person win.
